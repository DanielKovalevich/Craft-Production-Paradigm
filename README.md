# Craft-Production-Paradigm 
### What is this?
This program attempts to emulate the physical simulation developed by Dr. Aqlan of Penn State that 
helps teach the different manufacturing processes. In its current state, it is only a prototype
and is rough around the edges.

### How to run?
If you actually want to try it out, you need to start up both the frontend and backend servers via:
```bash
npm start
npm run client
```
In order to actually play the game, you will need to have three windows open of the game itself. 
This is because to play the game, you need a customer, a supplier, and an assembler.
